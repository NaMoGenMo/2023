National Movie Generation Month - based on [an idea Darius tweeted on a whim](https://twitter.com/tinysubversions/status/396305662000775168), where people are challenged to write code that makes a movie.

This is the 2023 edition.

## The Goal

Spend the month of November writing code that generates a movie of 40+ minutes. This is in the spirit of [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/) and the Academy's interesting [definition of a feature film](https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/93aa_rules.pdf) as 40 minutes. 

## The Rules

The only rule is that you share at least one movie and also your source code at the end.

The source code does not have to be licensed in a particular way, so long as you share it. The code itself does not need to be on GitHub, either. We use this repo as a place to organize the community. (Convenient because many programmers have GitHub accounts and the Issues section works like a forum with excellent syntax highlighting.)

The "movie" is defined however you want. It could be 40 minutes of a static picture of the word "meow". It could literally grab a random movie from Wikimedia Commons. It doesn't matter, as long as it's 40+ minutes.

_Please try to respect copyright._ We're not going to police it, as ultimately it's on your head if you want to just copy/paste a Stephen King movie or whatever, but the most useful/interesting implementations are going to be ones that don't engender lawsuits.

This activity starts at 12:01am GMT on Nov 1st and ends at 12:01am GMT Dec 1st.

## How to Participate

[Open an issue](../../issues/new) on this repo and declare your intent to participate. _If you already have some inkling of the kind of project you'll be doing, please title your issue accordingly._ You may continually update the issue as you work over the course of the month. Feel free to post dev diaries, sample output, etc.

If you have more than one project you're attempting, feel free to post a new issue for that project and keep that one up to date as well.

Also feel free to comment on [other participants' issues](../../issues).

## Admins

The official admin for NaMoGenMo is @ryanfox. I'll be doing my best to keep the issues section well organized and tagged.

## Resources

- There's [an open issue](../../issues/1) where you can add resources (libraries, corpuses, APIs, techniques, etc).
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - a multi-purpose command line video editing/mixing/creation tool
- [MoviePy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/) - a Python library for programatically creating and editing video
- [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) - a repository of open videos, images, and sounds

## That's It

Have fun!
